# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Micronutrient deficiencies are a significant public health issue in low- and middle-income countries, contributing to adverse birth outcomes. While Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation (MMS) has been shown to be more effective than IFA in clinical trials, rigorous implementation research is needed, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa like Botswana. We conducted a hybrid implementation-effectiveness pilot in 13 ANC clinics across three regions of Botswana from August 2024 to April 2025. The intervention involved the monthly provision of MMS and educational materials. We used a Difference-in-Difference (DiD) approach, leveraging data from the Tsepamo study, to compare implementation (MMS penetration/reach) and effectiveness outcomes (hemoglobin change and adverse birth outcomes) between intervention and non-intervention clinics during pre- and post-intervention periods. Secondary outcomes, including feasibility and acceptability, were assessed via surveys with clinic staff. MMS penetration significantly increased in intervention clinics, with a DiD estimate of 47.4% (95% CI: 43.8%, 51.1%). Clinic staff reported high acceptability and feasibility, citing improved tolerance and better adherence due to reduced pill burden. The intervention demonstrated that providing a reliable supply of MMS is a highly effective strategy to increase MMS uptake in routine ANC services in Botswana. However, a longer intervention period, sustained supply beyond the pilot, and complementary health education are crucial to translate high coverage into measurable clinical impact on maternal and birth outcomes.
